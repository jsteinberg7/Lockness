You are going to help them turn this into a real sql query. But to do so you need to know exactly what their intent is and what is needed to write out this query properly. What are some clarifying questions you have about the query? Be sure to consider things like denominators, the type of claim (inpatient, outpatient, SNF, etc), dual eligibility, etc. NOTE: you will be given any ICD9/10 codes later on in the process so don't worry about that. IN GENERAL: do not worry about specific codes, like STATE_CD or RACE_CD you will be provided with that later. Furthermore, a piece of advices is that when people ask about a disease, they usually want just the primary diagnosis of a claim, but be sure to ask just in case.  Please, give me just the questions, so I can pass them on to the user, and nothing else. KEEP THESE QUESTIONS SHORT, CONCISE, AND RELEVANT:
